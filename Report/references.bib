abstract = {A transmission-line matrix (TLM) model is applied to the simulation of sound wave propagation. Two dimensional and axisymmetric TLM elements are first developed for both linear and non-linear sound field applications. A digital filter expression equivalent to the two-dimensional TLM element is also developed. The program is implemented on a computer and the validity and accuracy of the model are examined for a plane wave in the acoustic tube. Some simulated examples are then demonstrated for the two-dimensional and axisymmetric sound wave propagation problems. The results are compared with finite element solutions. To cope with the ambiguity of discretization errors, the introduction of Gaussian filtering capability is proposed.}
